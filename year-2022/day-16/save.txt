This doens't work but I think I know what to do. I need to traverse the graph
and calculate the total pressure relieved by each path. I don't need to know the 
path I just need to know what most pressure relieved by the path. This should
not be too hard but my brain is mush tonight. Will go again tomorrow. 


maybe topological sort is something useful.
