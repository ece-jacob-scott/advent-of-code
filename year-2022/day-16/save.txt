This doens't work but I think I know what to do. I need to traverse the graph
and calculate the total pressure relieved by each path. I don't need to know the 
path I just need to know what most pressure relieved by the path. This should
not be too hard but my brain is mush tonight. Will go again tomorrow. 

skipping this puzzle for now to save my sanity will get back to it though before
the end of the year. I have a lot of time off coming up. 

You need to figure out the DFS algorithm with the right memoization of paths.
